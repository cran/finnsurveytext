\usage{
fst_concept_network(
  data,
  concepts,
  threshold = NULL,
  norm = "number_words",
  pos_filter = NULL,
  title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of text in CoNLL-U format, with optional additional
columns.}

\item{concepts}{List of terms to search for, separated by commas.}

\item{threshold}{A minimum number of occurrences threshold for 'edge' between
searched term and other word, default is `NULL`. Note, the threshold is
applied before normalisation.}

\item{norm}{The method for normalising the data. Valid settings are
`"number_words"` (the number of words in the responses), `"number_resp"`
(the number of responses), or `NULL` (raw count returned, default, also used
when weights are applied).}

\item{pos_filter}{List of UPOS tags for inclusion, default is `NULL` to
include all UPOS tags.}

\item{title}{Optional title for plot, default is `NULL` and a generic title
("TextRank extracted keyword occurrences") will be used.}
}
\value{
Plot of Concept Network.
}
\description{
This function takes a string of terms (separated by commas) or a single term
and, using `textrank_keywords()` from `textrank` package, filters data based
on `pos_filter` and finds words connected to search terms. Then it plots a
Concept Network based on the calculated weights of these terms and the
frequency of co-occurrences.
