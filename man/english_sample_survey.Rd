This data contains English text responses to ""Joeâ€™s doctor told him that he
would need to return in two weeks to find out whether or not his condition
had improved. But when Joe asked the receptionist for an appointment, he was
told that it would be over a month before the next available appointment.
What should Joe do?" as well as categorisation of these responses by two
coders as either destructive, passive, somewhat proactive, or proactive.
