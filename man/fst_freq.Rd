  data,
  number = 10,
  norm = NULL,
  pos_filter = NULL,

  name = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of text in CoNLL-U format, with optional additional
columns.}

\item{number}{The number of top words to return, default is `10`.}

\item{norm}{The method for normalising the data. Valid settings are
`"number_words"` (the number of words in the responses, default),
`"number_resp"` (the number of responses), or `NULL` (raw count returned).}

\item{pos_filter}{List of UPOS tags for inclusion, default is `NULL` which
means all word types included.}

\item{strict}{Whether to strictly cut-off at `number` (ties are
alphabetically ordered), default is `TRUE`.}

\item{name}{An optional "name" for the plot to add to title, default is
`NULL`.}

\item{use_svydesign_weights}{Option to weight words in the plot using
weights from a `svydesign` containing the raw data, default is `FALSE`}

\item{id}{ID column from raw data, required if `use_svydesign_weights = TRUE`
and must match the `docid` in formatted `data`.}

\item{svydesign}{A `svydesign` which contains the raw data and weights,
required if `use_svydesign_weights = TRUE`.}

\item{use_column_weights}{Option to weight words in the plot using
weights from  formatted data which includes addition `weight` column,
default is `FALSE`}
}
\value{
Plot of top words.
}
\description{
Creates a plot of the most frequently-occurring words (unigrams) within the
data. Optionally, weights can be provided either through a `weight` column
in the formatted data, or from a `svydesign` object with the raw
(preformatted) data.
