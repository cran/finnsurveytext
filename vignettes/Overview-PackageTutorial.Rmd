# 0. Install and Load Package

First, the `finnsurveytext` package needs to be installed into your R environment and loaded into the environment. You may also want to load in the `survey` package if you want to use a `svydesign` object for the data and/or weights. 

```{r}
library(finnsurveytext)
library(survey)
```

# 1. Data Preparation

The data preparation functions are used to take your raw survey data (in a dataframe or *svydesign* object within your R environment) and convert it into a standardised format ready for analysis. 

The functions in the remaining sections require your data to be pre-formatted into this format. 

(To learn move about the format we use, see the [Universal Dependencies Project](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html).)

### Option 1: Data is in a dataframe

The package comes with sample data. For this demonstration, we use `dev_coop`. The raw data looks like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
data(dev_coop)
knitr::kable(head(dev_coop, 5))
```

We will look at question 11_3 (responses to ''Jatka lausetta: Maailman kolme suurinta ongelmaa ovat... (Avokysymys)') as our open-ended survey question. We also want to include our survey weights (in 'paino' column) and bring in the gender and region columns so we can use these values to compare groups. 

The main function here is `fst_prepare()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITION
fst_prepare <- function(data,
                        question,
                        id,
                        model = "ftb",
                        stopword_list = "nltk",
                        weights = NULL,
                        add_cols = NULL,
                        manual = FALSE,
                        manual_list = "")
```

We can run the function as follows: 
```{r}
df <- fst_prepare(data = dev_coop,
                  question = 'q11_3', 
                  id = 'fsd_id', 
                  weights = 'paino',
                  add_cols = c('gender', 'region')
                  )
```


**Summary of components**

* `data` is the dataframe of interest. In this case, we are using data that comes with the package called "dev_coop".
* The `question` is the name of the column in your data which contains the open-ended survey question. In this example, we're considering "q11_3"
* `id` is the id column in our data, which is "fsd_id"
* The function also requires a Finnish language model available for `udpipe`, in this case we are using the default Finnish Treebank, `model = "ftb"`. (There are two options for Finnish language model; the other option is the Turku Dependency Treebank "tdt".)
* By default we will remove stopwords from the "nltk" `stopword_list` in this example. (To find the relevant lists of Finnish stopwords, you can run the `fst_find_stopwords()` function.) Punctuation is also removed from the data whenever stopwords are removed.
* Optionally, you can add a `weights` column in your formatted data. Our weights are stored in the raw data as "paino". 
* Optionally, you can add other columns to your formatted data (for use in comparison functions). We include our "gender" and "region" columns for this reason
* The results in CoNLL-U format are stored in the local environment as `df`. 
* (`manual` and `manual_list` are used if you want to provide your own list of stopwords to remove from the data.) 

The formatted data looks like this: 
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(df, 2))
```


### Option 2: Data is in a *svydesign* object

The other option is to get your data from a `svydesign` object from the `survey` package. The `survey` package is a popular package used for analysing surveys. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
svy_dev <- survey::svydesign(id = ~1, weights = ~paino, data =dev_coop)
```

The main function here is `fst_prepare_svydesign()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITION
fst_prepare_svydesign <- function(svydesign,
                                  question,
                                  id,
                                  model = "ftb",
                                  stopword_list = "nltk",
                                  use_weights = TRUE,
                                  add_cols = NULL,
                                  manual = FALSE,
                                  manual_list = "") 
```

We can run the function as follows: 
```{r}
df2 <- fst_prepare_svydesign(svydesign = svy_dev,
                            question = 'q11_3', 
                            id = 'fsd_id', 
                            use_weights = TRUE,
                            add_cols = c('gender', 'region')
                            )
```

**The only differences between the previous function and this one are:**

* `svydesign` is your *svydesign* object. In this case, we have one called "svy_dev"
* The *svydesign* object has a component called "prob" which contains the inverse of the weights. Therefore, we use these by setting `use_weights = TRUE`

The formatted data looks like this (should look very similar to the above formatted data!): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(df2, 2))
```

# 2. Data Exploration

Now that we have formatted data, we can begin data exploration. These functions are used to create summary tables and to find the most common themes in your survey responses. 

## Summary Tables

First, let's create some summaries using `fst_summarise`, `fst_pos` and `fst_length_summary`

These functions are defined as follows: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
fst_summarise <- function(data, 
                          desc = "All respondents") 

fst_pos <- function(data) 
  
fst_length_summary <- function(data,
                               desc = "All respondents",
                               incl_sentences = TRUE) 
```

**Summary of components**

* `data` is the formatted data.
* `desc` is an optional name for the responses summarised, if not provided it will default to "All respondents". 
* `incl_sentences` is an optional boolean for whether to also summarise sentence length (in addition to word length), if not provided it will default to TRUE. 

Hence, these functions are run for our sample data as follows: 

```{r}
fst_summarise(df)
fst_pos(df)
fst_length_summary(df)
```

## Identification of frequent words and phrases

### Wordclouds

The first of our frequent words visualisations in the wordcloud which comes from the `wordcloud` package.

It is defined as follows: 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITION
fst_wordcloud <- function(data,
                          pos_filter = NULL,
                          max = 100,
                          use_svydesign_weights = FALSE,
                          id = "",
                          svydesign = NULL,
                          use_column_weights = FALSE)
```

**Summary of components**

* `data` is the formatted data.
* `pos_filter` is an optional list of POS tags for inclusion in the wordcloud. The default is NULL.
* `max` is the maximum number of words to display, the default is 100.

Then, we have options for weighting the words in the cloud. These will all default to **not** include weights. 

* `use_svydesign_weights` should be set as TRUE if we want to use weights from within a *svydesign* object. 
* The `id` is only required if weights are coming from a *svydesign* object 
* The  `svydesign` object 


Here are some examples of creating wordclouds:
```{r}
fst_wordcloud(df)

```

```{r}
# We can only get weights from svydesign if they are NOT already in our formatted data. Hence we remove them for this demonstration!
df2$weight <- NULL
fst_wordcloud(df2, 
              pos_filter = c("NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ", "ADV"),
              max=100, 
              use_svydesign_weights = TRUE, 
              id = 'fsd_id', 
              svydesign = svy_dev)

```

### N-gram plots
Then, we have functions to identify and plot the most frequent words or n-grams (sets of n words in order). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
fst_freq <- function(data,
                     number = 10,
                     norm = NULL,
                     pos_filter = NULL,
                     strict = TRUE,
                     name = NULL,
                     use_svydesign_weights = FALSE,
                     id = "",
                     svydesign = NULL,
                     use_column_weights = FALSE)
  
fst_ngrams <- function(data,
                       number = 10,
                       ngrams = 1,
                       norm = NULL,
                       pos_filter = NULL,
                       strict = TRUE,
                       name = NULL,
                       use_svydesign_weights = FALSE,
                       id = "",
                       svydesign = NULL,
                       use_column_weights = FALSE)
```

**Summary of components**

* `data` is the formatted data.
* `number` is the number of top words/ngrams to display
* `ngrams` is the type of n-grams, default is `1`.
* `norm` is an optional method for normalising the data. Valid settings are "number_words" (the number of words in the responses), "number_resp" (the number of responses), or NULL (raw count returned, **default**, also used when weights are applied).
* `pos_filter` is an optional list of POS tags for inclusion. The default is NULL.
* `strict`  is whether to strictly cut-off at `number` (ties are alphabetically ordered). The default value is TRUE.
* The `name` is an optional "name" for the plot to add to title, default is NULL.

Then, we again have options for weighting the words in the plot. Again, these all default to **not** include weights. 

* `use_svydesign_weights` should be set as TRUE if we want to use weights from within a *svydesign* object. 
* The `id` is only required if weights are coming from a *svydesign* object 
* The  *svydesign* object 
* `use_svydesign_weights` should be set as TRUE if we want to use weights from the weight column as set-up during the data formatting. 

```{r}
fst_freq(df)

fst_ngrams(df, 
           number = 9, 
           ngrams = 2, 
           strict = FALSE,
           use_column_weights = TRUE)

fst_freq(df,
         number = 5, 
         strict = FALSE,)
```


(`fst_freq_table()` and `fst_ngrams_table()` can be used to instead create tables of the top words.)

```{r}
fst_freq_table(df, number = 15, strict = FALSE)
```


# 3. Concept Network

Our concept network function uses the TextRank algorithm which is a graph-based ranking model for text processing. Vertices represent words and co-occurrence between words is shown through edges. Word importance is determined recursively (through the unsupervised learning TextRank algorithm) where words get more weight based on how many words co-occur and the weight of these co-occurring words.

To utilise the TextRank algorithm in finnsurveytext, we use the textrank package. For further information on the package, please see [this documentation](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textrank). This package implements the TextRank and PageRank algorithms. (PageRank is the algorithm that Google uses to rank webpages.) You can read about the underlying TextRank algorithm [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) and about the PageRank algorithm [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-7552\(98\)00110-X).

The main concept network function is `fst_concept_network()`. It is defined as follows: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
fst_concept_network <- function(data,
                                concepts,
                                threshold = NULL,
                                norm = NULL,
                                pos_filter = NULL,
                                title = NULL) 
```

**Summary of components**

* `data` is the formatted data.
* `concepts` are the concept words around which the network is created.
* `threshold` is a minimum number of occurrences threshold for 'edge' between searched term and other word, default is `NULL`. Note, the threshold is applied before normalisation.
* `norm` is an optional method for normalising the data. Valid settings are "number_words" (the number of words in the responses), "number_resp" (the number of responses), or NULL (raw count returned, **default**, also used when weights are applied).
* `pos_filter` is an optional list of POS tags for inclusion. The default is NULL.
* `title` is an optional title for plot, default is `NULL` and a generic title ("TextRank extracted keyword occurrences") will be used.

For example, we can create the following concept network plots: 
```{r}
fst_concept_network(df, 
                    concepts = "köyhyys, nälänhätä, sota, ilmastonmuutos, puute", 
                    )
```


# 4. Comparison Functions

Recall that when we preprocessed the data, we included two additional columns, gender and region, to allow for comparison between respondents based on these values. 

There are counterpart comparison functions for each of the functions we have shown above. 

The comparison **summary tables** are defined as follows: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
fst_pos_compare <- function(data,
                            field,
                            exclude_nulls = FALSE,
                            rename_nulls = 'null_data')

fst_summarise_compare <- function(data,
                                  field,
                                  exclude_nulls = FALSE,
                                  rename_nulls = 'null_data')

fst_length_compare <- function(data,
                               field,
                               incl_sentences = TRUE,
                               exclude_nulls = FALSE,
                               rename_nulls = 'null_data') 
  
```

**Summary of Components**

* `data` is the formatted data.
* `field` is the column in `data` used for splitting groups
* We can choose whether to include or exclude surveys with no response in our splitting column by setting `exclude_nulls`. The default value is FALSE.
* `rename_nulls` is what to fill empty values with if `exclude_nulls = FALSE`.

Let's compare our responses based on the region of the respondent: 

```{r}
knitr::kable(fst_pos_compare(df, 'region'))

knitr::kable(fst_summarise_compare(df, 'region'))

knitr::kable(fst_length_compare(df, 'region'))
```

The **ngrams** comparison functions are defined similarly (with some additional new values):

```{r eval=FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
fst_freq_compare <- function(data,
                             field,
                             number = 10,
                             norm = NULL,
                             pos_filter = NULL,
                             strict = TRUE,
                             use_svydesign_weights = FALSE,
                             id = "",
                             svydesign = NULL,
                             use_column_weights = FALSE,
                             exclude_nulls = FALSE,
                             rename_nulls = 'null_data',
                             unique_colour = "indianred",
                             title_size = 20,
                             subtitle_size = 15)


fst_ngrams_compare <- function(data,
                              field,
                              number = 10,
                              ngrams = 1,
                              norm = NULL,
                              pos_filter = NULL,
                              strict = TRUE,
                              use_svydesign_weights = FALSE,
                              id = "",
                              svydesign = NULL,
                              use_column_weights = FALSE,
                              exclude_nulls = FALSE,
                              rename_nulls = 'null_data',
                              unique_colour = "indianred",
                              title_size = 20,
                              subtitle_size = 15)
```

The **new components** are: 

* `unique_colour` is chosen to differentiate values which are unique to one group of respondents, the default is "indianred"
* `title_size` and `subtitle_size` set these, you may need to change them from the default values if any of your group names are long or if there are many groups.

For the ngrams, let's compare respondents by gender. 

```{r}
fst_freq_compare(df, 
                 'gender', 
                 use_column_weights = TRUE,
                 exclude_nulls = TRUE)

fst_ngrams_compare(df, 
                   'gender', 
                   ngrams = 2, 
                   use_column_weights = TRUE, 
                   exclude_nulls = TRUE)
```

The **comparison cloud** extends the wordcloud concept. 

A comparison cloud compares the relative frequency with which a term is used in two or more documents. This cloud shows words that occur more regularly in responses from a specific type of respondent. For more information about comparison clouds, you can read [this documentation](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wordcloud).

The comparison cloud is defined as follows, with settings as defined for the previous functions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITION
fst_comparison_cloud <- function(data,
                                 field,
                                 pos_filter = NULL,
                                 norm = NULL,
                                 max = 100,
                                 use_svydesign_weights = FALSE,
                                 id = "",
                                 svydesign = NULL,
                                 use_column_weights = FALSE,
                                 exclude_nulls = FALSE,
                                 rename_nulls = "null_data") 
```

Thus, we can create comparison clouds: 
```{r, out.width = '750px', dpi=200}
fst_comparison_cloud(df, 'gender', max = 40, use_column_weights = TRUE, exclude_nulls = TRUE)
```


Finally we have the comparison **concept network** which has the following components which should be familiar from previous functions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# FUNCTION DEFINITION
fst_concept_network_compare <- function(data,
                                        concepts,
                                        field,
                                        norm = NULL,
                                        threshold = NULL,
                                        pos_filter = NULL,
                                        exclude_nulls = FALSE,
                                        rename_nulls = 'null_data',
                                        title_size = 20,
                                        subtitle_size = 15)
```

We run the comparison concept network as follows: 

```{r}
fst_concept_network_compare(df, 
                            concepts = "köyhyys, nälänhätä, sota, ilmastonmuutos, puute", 
                            'gender',
                            exclude_nulls = TRUE
                            )
```
