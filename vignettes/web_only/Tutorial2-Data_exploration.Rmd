## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a common activity once data has been cleaned and prepared. EDA involves running functions which allow you to better understand the responses and begin to formulate initial hypotheses based on the data. 

This tutorial follows on from Tutorial 1 and guides you through an EDA of data which has been prepared into CoNLL-U format. These EDA functions are contained in `r/02_data_exploration.R`.

### Installation of package.

Once the package is installed, you can load the `finnsurveytext` package as below:
(Other required packages such as `dplyr` and `stringr` will also be installed if they are not currently installed in your environment.)

```{r setup}
library(finnsurveytext)
```

### Overview of Functions 

The functions covered in this tutorial are: 

1. `fst_summarise_short()`
2. `fst_summarise()`
3. `fst_pos()`
4. `fst_length_summary()`
5. `fst_get_top_words()`
6. `fst_get_top_ngrams()`
7. `fst_get_top_ngrams2()`
8. `fst_freq_plot()`
9. `fst_ngrams_plot()`
10. `fst_wordcloud()`
12. `fst_freq()`
13. `fst_ngrams()`


### Data
There are two sets of data files available within the package which could be used in this tutorial. These files have been created following the process demonstrated in Tutorial 1. The suffixes 'iso', 'nltk' and 'snow' refer to the types of stopwords which have been removed during the data preparation activities.  

##### 1. Child Barometer Data
* data/conllu_cb_bullying.rda
* data/conllu_cb_bullying_iso.rda

##### 2. Development Cooperation Data
* data/conllu_dev_q11_1.rda
* data/conllu_dev_q11_1_nltk.rda
* data/conllu_dev_q11_1_snow.rda
* data/conllu_dev_q11_2.rda
* data/conllu_dev_q11_2_nltk.rda
* data/conllu_dev_q11_3.rda
* data/conllu_dev_q11_3_nltk.rda

You can read these in as follows: 

```{r}
bullying <- conllu_cb_bullying_iso
knitr::kable(head(bullying))
q11_1 <- conllu_dev_q11_1_nltk
```

## FUNCTIONS

### Get Summary Table functions
`fst_summarise_short()` and `fst_summarise()`

This first function creates a simple summary table for the data that shows the total number of words, number of unique words, and number of unique lemmas in the data. You can either view the table in the console, or define a variable which will contain this table. 

The second function adds information about the number and proportion of survey respondents which answered this question.

```{r}
fst_summarise_short(data = bullying)

q11_1_summary_table <- fst_summarise(data = q11_1, desc = "All")
knitr::kable(q11_1_summary_table)
```

`fst_summarise_short()` and `fst_summarise()` take 1 argument:

1. `data` is output from data preparation, prepared data in CoNLL-U format, such as the output of `fst_prepare_connlu()`.

`fst_summarise()` takes an optional second argument:

2. `desc` is an optional string describing respondents. This description is included in the table in the first column. If not defined, it will default to 'All respondents'.  

### Get Part-Of-Speech Summary Table function
`fst_pos()`

This function creates a table which counts the number and proportion of words of each part-of-speech (POS) tag within the data. Again, you can either view the table in the console, or define a variable which will contain this table.

```{r}
fst_pos(data = bullying)

q11_1_pos_table <- fst_pos(data = q11_1)
knitr::kable(q11_1_pos_table)
```

`fst_pos()` takes 1 argument:

1. `data` is output from data preparation, prepared data in CoNLL-U format, such as the output of `fst_prepare_connlu()`.


### Get Length Summary Table function
`fst_length_summary()`

This function creates a table which summarises the distribution of lengths in the responses. Again, you can either view the table in the console, or define a variable which will contain this table.

```{r}
fst_length_summary(data = bullying, desc = "All Bullying Respondents")

q11_1_length_table <- fst_length_summary(data = q11_1, incl_sentences = FALSE)
knitr::kable(q11_1_length_table)
```

`fst_length_summary()` takes 3 arguments:

1. `data` is output from data preparation, prepared data in CoNLL-U format, such as the output of `fst_prepare_connlu()`.
2. `desc` is an optional string describing respondents. If not defined, it will remain blank in the table meaning that the 'Description' column will only show whether the row is showing data for words or sentences.  
3. `incl_sentences` is a boolean of whether to include sentence data in table, default is `TRUE`. If `incl_sentences = TRUE`, the table will also provide length information for the number of sentences within responses. If `incl_sentences = FALSE`, the table will show only show results for the number of words in responses. 

## Top Words and N-grams Tables

Next we will demonstrate some functions which are used to create plots of most frequent words and n-grams occurring in the data. An n-gram is a set of n successive words in the data. 

### Make Top Words Table function
`fst_get_top_words()` 

This functions creates a table of the most frequently occurring words in the data (noting that "stopwords" may have been removed in previous data preparation steps.) 

The top words tables is able have the words normalised if you choose. The variable `norm` is the method for normalising the data. Valid settings are `'number_words'` (the number of words in the responses, default), `'number_resp'` (the number of responses), or `NULL` (raw count returned).

Optionally, you can indicate which POS tags to include. 

In this function, you must determine what you want to do in the case of ties with the variable `strict`. Words with equal occurrence are presented in alphabetial order. By default, words are presented in order to the `number` cutoff word. This means that equally-occurring later-alphabetically words beyond the cutoff word **will not** be displayed. Alternatively, you can decide that the cutoff is not strict, in which case words occurring equally often as the `number` cutoff words **will** be displayed.
(`fst_get_top_words()` will print a message regarding this decision.)

We run the functions as follows:

```{r}
fst_get_top_words(data = bullying)

fst_get_top_words(
  data = bullying,
  number = 15,
  norm = NULL,
  pos_filter = c("NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ", "ADV"),
  strict = FALSE
)

table1 <- fst_get_top_words(data = q11_1, number = 5)
knitr::kable(table1)

table2 <- fst_get_top_words(data = q11_1, number = 5, norm = "number_resp", pos_filter = c("NOUN", "VERB"), strict = FALSE)
knitr::kable(table2)
```

`fst_get_top_words()` takes 4 arguments:

1. `data` is output from data preparation, prepared data in CoNLL-U format, such as the output of `fst_prepare_connlu()`.
2. `number` is the number of top words/n-grams to return, default is `10` which means that the top 10 words will be returned.
3. `norm` is the method for normalising the data. Valid settings are `'number_words'` (the number of words in the responses, default), `'number_resp'` (the number of responses), or `NULL` (raw count returned).
4. `pos_filter` is an optional list of which POS tags to include such as `'c("NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ", "ADV")'`. The default is `NULL`, in which case all words in the data are considered.
5. `strict` is a boolean that determines how the function will deal with 'ties'. If `strict = TRUE`, the table will cut-off at the exact `number`(words are presented in alphabetical order so later-alphabetically, equally occurring words to the word at `number` will not be shown.) If `strict = FALSE`, the table will show any words that occur equally frequently as the number cutoff word. 

### Make Top N-Grams Table function
`fst_get_top_ngrams()`

Similar to `fst_get_top_words()`, this functions creates a table of the most frequently occurring n-grams in the data (noting that "stopwords" may have been removed in previous data preparation steps.) 

The top n-grams tables are able have the n-grams normalised if you choose. The variable `norm` is the method for normalising the data. Valid settings are `'number_words'` (the number of words in the responses, default), `'number_resp'` (the number of responses), or `NULL` (raw count returned).

Optionally, you can indicate which POS tags to include. 

In this function, you must determine what you want to do in the case of ties with the variable `strict`. N-grams with equal occurrence are presented in alphabetial order. By default, n-grams are presented in order to the `number` cutoff n-gram. This means that equally-occurring later-alphabetically n-grams beyond the cutoff n-gram **will not** be displayed. Alternatively, you can decide that the cutoff is not strict, in which case n-grams occurring equally often as the `number` cutoff n-gram **will** be displayed.
(`fst_get_top_ngrams()` will print a message regarding this decision. There is another function `fst_get_top_ngrams2()` which doesn't print a message. This function is used within the comparison functions in `04_comparison_functions.R`)

We run the functions as follows:

```{r}
fst_get_top_ngrams(data = bullying, ngrams = 2)

fst_get_top_ngrams(data = bullying, ngrams = 2, norm = "number_words", strict = FALSE)

table3 <- fst_get_top_ngrams(data = q11_1, number = 15, ngrams = 3)
knitr::kable(table3)

table4 <- fst_get_top_ngrams(data = q11_1, number = 15, ngrams = 2, pos_filter = c("NOUN", "VERB"), strict = FALSE)
knitr::kable(table4)
```

`fst_get_top_ngrams()` has the same setup as `fst_get_top_words()` plus an additional argument `ngrams`: 

1. `data` is output from data preparation, prepared data in CoNLL-U format, such as the output of `fst_prepare_connlu()`.
2. `number` is the number of top words/n-grams to return, default is `10` which means that the top 10 n-grams will be returned.
3. `ngrams` is the type of n-grams. The default is "1" (so top words). Set `ngrams = 2` to get bigrams and `n = 3` to get trigrams etc. 
4. `norm` is the method for normalising the data. Valid settings are `'number_words'` (the number of words in the responses, default), `'number_resp'` (the number of responses), or `NULL` (raw count returned).
5. `pos_filter` is an optional list of which POS tags to include such as `'c("NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ", "ADV")'`. The default is `NULL`, in which case all words in the data are considered.
6. `strict` is a boolean that determines how the function will deal with 'ties'. If `strict = TRUE`, the table will cut-off at the exact `number`(n-grams are presented in alphabetical order so later-alphabetically, equally occurring n-grams to the n-gram at `number` will not be shown.) If `strict = FALSE`, the table will show any n-grams that occur equally frequently as the number cutoff n-gram. 

### Make Top Words/N-grams Tables functions
`fst_freq_plot()`

4. `ngrams` is the type of n-grams. As you can see above, you can plot top words using `ngrams = 1`.

### Find and Plot Top Words function
`fst_freq()`

This functions runs `fst_get_top_words()` and `fst_freq_plot()` within one function:

```{r}
fst_freq(data = q11_1, number = 12, strict = FALSE, name = "Q11_1")
```

The arguments are as defined in the component functions:

5. `strict` is a boolean that determines how the function will deal with 'ties'. If `strict = TRUE`, the table will cut-off at the exact `number`(words are presented in alphabetical order so later-alphabetically, equally occurring words to the word at `number` will not be shown.) If `strict = FALSE`, the table will show any words that occur equally frequently as the number cutoff word.

## Conclusion
EDA of open-ended survey questions can be conducted using functions in `r/02_data_exploration.R` such as finding most frequent words and n-grams, summarising the length of responses and words used, and visualising responses in word clouds. The results of this EDA can help researchers better understand their data, create hypotheses based on this initial insights, and inform future analysis of the surveys.
