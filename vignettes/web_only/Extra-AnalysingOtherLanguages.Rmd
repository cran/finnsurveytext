# How to Use `finnsurveytext` in another language!

Despite the package's name, `finnsurveytext` can be used to analyse surveys in **LOTS** of different languages. This vignette aims to explain how to use `finnsurveytext` in another language with as little additional effort as possible. 

The reason `finnsurveytext` can be used with other languages is that the packages it employs to process the raw survey data work in multiple languages! So we have the developers of the `udpipe` and `stopwords` packages to thank! 

There is a survey in English provided with the package called `english_sample_survey` which we will use to demonstrate the use of the package in a language other than Finnish. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(english_sample_survey, 5))
```


# 1. Essential: Your language has a language model available for `udpipe` 

The `udpipe` package is available from the [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=udpipe). The relevant `udpipe` function we use is `udpipe::udpipe_download_model`. You can see the list of available models in the `udpipe` [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/udpipe/udpipe.pdf). 

At the time of writing this vignette, these were: 

> afrikaans-afribooms, ancient_greek-perseus, ancient_greek-proiel, arabic-padt, armenian-armtdp, basque-bdt, belarusian-hse, bulgarian-btb, buryat-bdt, catalan-ancora, chinese-gsd, chinese-gsdsimp, coptic-scriptorium, croatian-set, czech-cac, czech-cltt, czech-fictree, czech-pdt, danish-ddt, dutch-alpino, dutch-lassysmall, english-ewt, english-gum, english-lines, english-partut, estonian-edt, finnish-ftb, finnish-tdt, french-gsd, french-partut, french-sequoia, french-spoken, galician-ctg, galician-treegal, german-gsd, german-hdt, gothic-proiel, greek-gdt, hebrew-htb, hindi-hdtb, hungarian-szeged, indonesian-gsd, irish-idt, italian-isdt, italian-partut, italian-postwita, italian-twittiro, japanese-gsd, kazakh-ktb, korean-gsd, korean-kaist, kurmanji-mg, latin-ittb, latin-perseus, latin-proiel, latvian-lvtb, lithuanian-hse, maltese-mudt, marathi-ufal, north_sami-giella, norwegian-bokmaal, norwegian-nynorsk, norwegian-nynorsklia, old_church_slavonic-proiel, old_french-srcmf, persian-seraji, polish-lfg, polish-sz, portuguese-bosque, portuguese-br, portuguese-gsd, romanian-nonstandard, romanian-rrt, russian-gsd, russian-syntagrus, russian-taiga, sanskrit-ufal, scottish_gaelic-arcosg, serbian-set, slovak-snk, slovenian-ssj, slovenian-sst, spanish-ancora, spanish-gsd, swedish-lines, swedish-talbanken, tamil-ttb, telugu-mtg, turkish-imst, ukrainian-iu, upper_sorbian-ufal, urdu-udtb, uyghur-udt, vietnamese-vtb

Alternatively, you can find the list of available models by running `fst_print_available_models()`. By providing a `search` term, the list will be filtered for models containing this language: 

```{r}
fst_print_available_models()

fst_print_available_models(search = 'estonian')

fst_print_available_models('sami')
```


## How to use: 
The relevant model, eg "swedish-talbanken", should be used for the `model` input in `fst_format()` or `fst_prepare()`

### Demonstration:

We find an English model and format our English data below: 

```{r}
fst_print_available_models("english")

en_df <- fst_format(data = english_sample_survey,
           question = 'text', 
           id = 'id', 
           model = 'english-ewt'
           )

knitr::kable(head(en_df, 5))
```




# 2. Recommended: Your language has a stopwords list available for `stopwords` package

The `stopwords` package is available from the [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stopwords). The relevant `stopwords` functions are `stopwords::stopwords`,  `stopwords::stopwords_getsources` and `stopwords::stopwords_getlanguages`. We recommend you first identify the two-letter [ISO code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) for the language you are using. You can see the list of available sources and languages in the `stopwords` [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stopwords/stopwords.pdf) or by running the 'get sources' and 'get languages' functions: 

```{r}
stopwords_getsources()
stopwords::stopwords_getlanguages(source = 'nltk')
stopwords('da', source = 'nltk')
stopwords('da') # The default source is 'snowball'

```
Alternatively, you can use our function `fst_find_stopwords` to simplify this process. This function provides a table of lists available through the `stopwords` package for a language and provides the contents for comparison (if you have multiple options!). To run this, you need the two-letter ISO language code: 

```{r}
knitr::kable(fst_find_stopwords(language = 'lv'))
fst_find_stopwords(language = 'no')
```


## How to use: 
The relevant language and stopword list ('source'), eg "sv" and "nltk", should be used for the `language` and `stopword_list` inputs respectively in `fst_prepare()` (or `fst_rm_stop_punct()` which is automatically called within `fst_prepare()`).

### Demonstration: 

We can find and compare English stopwords lists as below. Once we have chosen a stopwords list, we can run `fst_prepare()` to format the data and remove the stopwords:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(fst_find_stopwords(language = 'en'), 5))

en_df2 <- fst_prepare(data = english_sample_survey,
                      question = 'text',
                      id = 'id',
                      model = 'english-ewt',
                      stopword_list = 'smart', 
                      language = 'en')

knitr::kable(head(en_df2, 5))
```


# 2b. Optional: Provide your own list of stopwords
If a stopword list is not available for your language, or you would like to provide your own, you can use the `manual_list` option within `fst_prepare()` (or `fst_rm_stop_punct()`) making sure to also either set `manual = TRUE` or `stopwords_list = "manual"`. 

You can also chose to not remove stopwords but you may find that you want to remove them to get more meaningful results!

If you provide a manual list, you can leave `language` as its default values. 

#### Demonstration
```{r}
#EXAMPLE OF PROVIDING A MANUAL LIST
manualList <- c('and', 'the', 'of', 'you', 'me', 'ours', 'mine', 'them', 'theirs')
manualList2 <- "to, the, I"

df1 <- fst_prepare(data = english_sample_survey,
                  question = 'text',
                  id = 'id',
                  model = 'english-ewt',
                  manual_list = manualList,
                  stopword_list = 'manual'
                  )

knitr::kable(head(df1, 5))

df2 <- fst_prepare(data = english_sample_survey,
                  question = 'text',
                  id = 'id',
                  model = 'english-ewt',
                  manual = TRUE,
                  manual_list = manualList2
                  )

knitr::kable(head(df2, 5))

```



The remainder of the package works the same regardless of language of survey responses. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
unlink('english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe')
```
