# How to Use `finnsurveytext` in another language!

Despite the package's name, `finnsurveytext` can be used to analyse surveys in **LOTS** of different languages. This vignette aims to explain how to use `finnsurveytext` in another language with as little additional effort as possible. 

The reason `finnsurveytext` can be used with other languages is that the packages it employs to process the raw survey data work in multiple languages! So we have the developers of the `udpipe` and `stopwords` packages to thank! 

# 1. Essential: Your language has a language model available for `udpipe` 

The `udpipe` package is available from the [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=udpipe). The relevant `udpipe` function we use is `udpipe::udpipe_download_model`. You can see the list of available models in the `udpipe` [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/udpipe/udpipe.pdf). 

At the time of writing this vignette, these were: 

> afrikaans-afribooms, ancient_greek-perseus, ancient_greek-proiel, arabic-padt, armenian-armtdp, basque-bdt, belarusian-hse, bulgarian-btb, buryat-bdt, catalan-ancora, chinese-gsd, chinese-gsdsimp, coptic-scriptorium, croatian-set, czech-cac, czech-cltt, czech-fictree, czech-pdt, danish-ddt, dutch-alpino, dutch-lassysmall, english-ewt, english-gum, english-lines, english-partut, estonian-edt, finnish-ftb, finnish-tdt, french-gsd, french-partut, french-sequoia, french-spoken, galician-ctg, galician-treegal, german-gsd, german-hdt, gothic-proiel, greek-gdt, hebrew-htb, hindi-hdtb, hungarian-szeged, indonesian-gsd, irish-idt, italian-isdt, italian-partut, italian-postwita, italian-twittiro, japanese-gsd, kazakh-ktb, korean-gsd, korean-kaist, kurmanji-mg, latin-ittb, latin-perseus, latin-proiel, latvian-lvtb, lithuanian-hse, maltese-mudt, marathi-ufal, north_sami-giella, norwegian-bokmaal, norwegian-nynorsk, norwegian-nynorsklia, old_church_slavonic-proiel, old_french-srcmf, persian-seraji, polish-lfg, polish-sz, portuguese-bosque, portuguese-br, portuguese-gsd, romanian-nonstandard, romanian-rrt, russian-gsd, russian-syntagrus, russian-taiga, sanskrit-ufal, scottish_gaelic-arcosg, serbian-set, slovak-snk, slovenian-ssj, slovenian-sst, spanish-ancora, spanish-gsd, swedish-lines, swedish-talbanken, tamil-ttb, telugu-mtg, turkish-imst, ukrainian-iu, upper_sorbian-ufal, urdu-udtb, uyghur-udt, vietnamese-vtb

## How to use: 
The relevant model, eg "swedish-talbanken", should be used for the `model` input in `fst_format()` or `fst_prepare()`



# 2. Recommended: Your language has a stopwords list available for `stopwords` package

The `stopwords` package is available from the [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stopwords). The relevant `stopwords` functions are `stopwords::stopwords`,  `stopwords::stopwords_getsources` and `stopwrds::stopwords_getlanguages`. We recommend you first identify the two-letter [ISO code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) for the language you are using. You can see the list of available sources and languages in the `stopwords` [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stopwords/stopwords.pdf) or by running the 'get sources' and 'get languages' functions: 

```{r}
stopwords_getsources()
stopwords::stopwords_getlanguages(source = 'nltk')
stopwords('da', source = 'nltk')
stopwords('da') # The default source is 'snowball'

```
Alternatively, you can use our function `fst_find_stopwords` to simplify this process. This function provides a table of lists available through the `stopwords` package for a language and provides the contents for comparison (if you have multiple options!). To run this, you need the two-letter ISO language code: 

```{r}
knitr::kable(fst_find_stopwords(language = 'lv'))
fst_find_stopwords(language = 'no')
```


## How to use: 
The relevant language and stopword list ('source'), eg "sv" and "nltk", should be used for the `language` and `stopword_list` inputs respectively in `fst_prepare()` (or `fst_rm_stop_punct()` which is automatically called within `fst_prepare()`).

# 2b. Optional: Provide your own list of stopwords
If a stopword list is not available for your language, or you would like to provide your own, you can use the `manual_list` option within `fst_prepare()` (or `fst_rm_stop_punct()`) making sure to also set `manual = TRUE`. 

You can also chose to not remove stopwords but you may find that you want to remove them to get more meaningful results!

If you provide a manual list, you can leave `stopword_list` and `language` as their default values. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
#EXAMPLE OF PROVIDING A MANUAL LIST
manualList <- c('en', 'et', 'ei', 'emme', 'ette', 'eiv채t', 'min채', 'minum')
manualList2 <- "en, et, ei, emme, ette, eiv채t, min채, minum"

df <- fst_prepare(data = surveydata,
                  question = 'oe_qn',
                  id = 'id',
                  model = 'model-available-for-udpipe',
                  manual_list = manualList
                  )
```

## Example of Use #1
For example, if I had a survey in Swedish, I could chose either 'swedish-lines' or 'swedish-talbanken' based on my preferences. Noting the ISO code is 'sv', I could check my favourite stopwords list, 'nltk' and discover Swedish is there and choose to remove stopwrods from this list from my data. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(fst_find_stopwords('sv'))
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
df <- fst_prepare(data = swedish_survey,
                  question = 'swedish_question',
                  id = 'swedish_id',
                  model = "swedish-lines",
                  stopword_list = "nltk",
                  language = 'sv'
                  )


```


## Example of Use #2
If I had a survey in Estonian, I could happily note that 'estonian-edt' is available for `udpipe`, find the ISO code is 'et' and discover that there is an estonian wor process the responses to the open-ended question as follows: 

```{r}
knitr::kable(fst_find_stopwords('et'))
```


```{r eval = FALSE}
df <- fst_prepare(data = surveydata,
                  question = 'oe_question',
                  id = 'ID',
                  model = "ftb",
                  stopword_list = "stopwords-iso",
                  language = 'et',
                  weights = NULL,
                  add_cols = NULL,
                  manual = FALSE,
                  manual_list = "")
```


The remainder of the package works the same regardless of language of survey responses.
